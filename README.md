# fluent-plugin-newrelic

A [Fluentd](https://fluentd.org/) output plugin that sends logs to New Relic

This project is provided AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OR SUPPORT, although you can report issues and contribute to the project here on GitHub.

## Examples

Please see the [examples](examples/) directory for ways to build a Docker image with the New Relic output plugin and other configuration types
that could be useful in your environment.

## Prerequisites

Fluentd >= v1.0

## Installation

Add the plugin to your fluentd agent:

`fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-newrelic`

If you are using td-agent:

`td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-newrelic`

For more info, review [Fluentd's official documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/plugin-management).

## Configuration

### Required plugin configuration

This plugin must be configured with either a New Relic API Insert key, or a New Relic License key.
If both types of keys are specified, the API Insert key will take precedence.

To specify an API Insert key, either set the `api_key` property in the configuration, or set the `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` environment variable. If both are specified, the configuration property will take precedence.

To specify a license key, either set the `license_key` property in the configuration, or set the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. If both are specified, the configuration property will take precedence.

### Optional plugin configuration

| Property | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
| base_uri | New Relic ingestion endpoint | `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1` |

### EU plugin configuration

If you are running this plugin in the eu set the `base_uri` to `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`.

### Fields

* To make Kubernetes log forwarding easier, any `log` field in a log event will be
renamed to `message`, overwriting any `message` field. Kubernetes logs have their messages
in a `log` field, while we want messages in a `message` field.

### Example

Add one of the following blocks to your Fluentd config file (with your specific key), then restart Fluentd.

#### Using Insights Inserts Key

Example using Insights Insert key:

```rb
<match **>
  @type newrelic
  api_key <NEW_RELIC_INSIGHTS_INSERT_KEY>
</match>
```

Getting your New Relic Insights Insert key:
`https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/manage/api_keys`

#### Using License Key

Example using License key:

```rb
<match **>
  @type newrelic
  license_key <NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY>
</match>
```

Getting your New Relic license key:
`https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>`
